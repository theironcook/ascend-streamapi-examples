// First edit the client_id and client_secret variables below with the values that you use

// Then open a command line from the the root diretory (where this file is) and type:
// npm i (assuming you have installed NodeJS)
// node example-amqp.js

    // Now use the existing rest api to fetch a new streaming api url

    const {data: {url: streamApiUrl, exchanges, queues, routingKeys, user}} = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/ascend-streaming-api/url`);

    // streamApiUrl contains all of the authentication and where the location of the stream api is
    
    // exchanges and queues are the rabbitmq exchange and queue patterns your client_id has access to
    // it's how we make sure client only access data they should be able to
    console.log(`Exchanges: ${exchanges}`);
    console.log(`Queues: ${queues}`);       
    console.log(`Stream api url: ${streamApiUrl}`);

    // If you look at the streamApiUrl, you will notice that the user is actually a JWT that you can look at in jwt.io
    // It contains informatio about what you have access to in the Stream API - although much of that information is exposed
    // like the exchanges etc. shown above for convenience - so clients don't need to parse the JWT user manually
    


    // How to set up a queue to listen for creates, updates or deletes in the api

    // This example uses amqplib but other options exist for NodeJS and there are amqp libraries for most languages
    // Other libraries for other languages will do things a little differently but all share the same basic concepts of 
    // exchanges, queues, bindings etc.
    // https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html
    
    // First create a connection
    const streamApiConnection = await connect(streamApiUrl);

    // Register for any connection errors
    streamApiConnection.on('error', async (err) => {
      console.error('Error in the main stream api connection: ', err);
      // Probably want some logging and a paused retry to re-establish the connection after a minute
    });

    // Next create a channel
    const channel = await streamApiConnection.createChannel();

    // Now bind a queue that you can listen to
    // You should add a "." with something afterwards to name your queues
    // The names should be reused / consistent through your applications
    // You can only create a single queue with this name - queue names are globally unique (for your account)
    const queueName = `${queues}.testqueue-${Math.random().toString().substring(3, 10)}`;

    // Assert the queue into existence
    // The queue in the example below will be deleted as soon as the process stops running
    // If you set durable: true, autoDelete: false, exclusive: false, the queue will be retained in the Ascend rabbitmq cluster
    // even after the process or connections stopped.  Messages will continue to accumulate in the queue until
    // you start consuming them again. Ascend will purge these queues after a period of time - otherwise we would run out of disk space.  
    // Be very careful how many unique queues (by the queueName) you create that are durable and make sure you responsibly listen to those queues
    // so you don't end up clogging up the rabbit cluster
    await channel.assertQueue(queueName, {durable: false, autoDelete: true, exclusive: true});


    // Bind the queue to to your exchange - otherwise no data will flow to your queue
    // Best practice is to only bind to routing keys that you will actually listen to - otherwise you will see quite a bit of
    // data flowing to your queue that you might throw away

    // RabbitMQ topic routing keys follow the pattern: 
    // orgId.locationId.domainType.operationType

    // In this example, you will only get messages for the OperatoryV1 and PatientV1 domain types
    await channel.bindQueue(queueName, exchanges, '*.*.OperatoryV1.*');
    await channel.bindQueue(queueName, exchanges, '*.*.PatientV1.*');

    // todo - add any other domain types types (with the versions you are using) or you will not recieve those types of updates

    // It's very bad practice to bind to *.*.*.* unless you truly want to listen to all domain types
    // The system will be flooded with messages that are thrown away.    

    // Now that the queue is created and bound to the right exchange routing keys, you can
    // listen to the queue for any new data that flows through it
    await channel.consume(queueName, (message) => {
      console.log('\nReceived a message from stream API: ');

      // uncomment to see entire payload
      // console.log(JSON.stringify(message));

      // Useful fields in the payload
      const routingKey = _.get(message, 'fields.routingKey') || '';
      const [orgId, locationId, domainType, operation] = routingKey.split('.');
      console.log(`  routingKey=${routingKey}`);
      console.log(`  domainType=${domainType}`); // probably a useful field to look at in a message

      // Here is the actual message payload
      const payload = JSON.parse(message.content.toString('UTF-8'));
      // Note that you will only see the fields that have changed.  If a field hasn't been updated, you should not see it in the payload
      console.log(`  payload=${JSON.stringify(payload)}`);      
    });

    console.log('Listening to the stream api.  You need to use the normal rest api to save something like a Patient to see data flow.')


    // To see messages flow you will need to create, update or delete data in the Ascend rest api.
    // The initial example only listens to OperatoryV1 or PatientV1 domain models so you will need to test with those domain
    // types unless you change the queue bindings

    // The simplest way to use the rest api is via https://portal.hs1api.com/ but tools like Postman are easier to use for real development
    // Make sure that you are updating data for the exact same client_id that you used in this code example - or at least 
    // a client_id with access to the same organizations

    // Remember that messages only flow for PUT if anything has actually changed
