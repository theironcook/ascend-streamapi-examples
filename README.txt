There are 2 examples in this project.  
The first shows how to use NodeJS with the AMQP protocol.
The second shows how to use a Browser with the STOMP protocol (over secure web sockets).

RabbitMQ has many libraries for almost all languages.  This project only shows 2 simple ones
that you can start with
https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html

RabbitMQ can expose several protocols as well. 
The Ascend API exposes secure AMQP and the STOMP protocol over secure web sockets.
STOMP is typically for client side / browser applications but it can also be used
for backend implementations as well.  If you use STOMP in a browser, never share
your client_id and client_secret with your browser code like the simple example code.
Always keep your credentials safe and negotiate stream api urls from your safe
server side code.  Fetch stream api urls from your safe server code and pass the
stream api url credentials to your insecure browser client.


To run either example, first install all required dependencies.
Make sure you have a recent version of NodeJS installed on your machine.  
Open a command line / terminal, navigate to the root directory.
> npm i

To run the NodeJS / AMQP example:
Update the client_id and client_secret inside of of example-amqp.js and the run
> npm run start-amqp
You can add an optional parameter "qa" if you want to run the example in qa.  (this is mostly for API devs / testers)
> npm run start-amqp qa

Look at the source code in example-amqp.js to follow along with how to use the stream api



To run the Stomp example that runs in a browser run:
> npm run start-stomp
You can add an optional parameter "qa" if you want to run the example in qa.  (this is mostly for API devs / testers)
> npm run start-stomp qa

Most of the source code for the stomp example can be found in example-stomp.js and example-stomp.html.
To see the example running open a browser at http://localhost:3039 (assuming that port was open on your computer)

Make sure to open the browser console to see useful errors / messages as the example runs
